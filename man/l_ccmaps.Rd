}
\arguments{
\item{tt}{Tk top level window. Defaults to a new window}

\item{cc_inspector}{Whether to draw the custom inspector for CCmaps, which
allows for variable selection, variable label update, font size adjustment
and option to optimize \eqn{R^2}. Defaults to TRUE. Once created, the inspector
can only be closed when the main display window is closed}

\item{title}{Title of the map. Appears in the title bar of the toplevel window.
Defaults to "CCmaps"}

\item{spdf}{\code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} object to hold polygon coordinates
and attributes. It should contain all variables used in analysis}

\item{respvar}{Name of the response value variable}

\item{respvar.lab}{Label for response value variable for slider. Defaults to NULL,
in which case \code{respvar} is used}

\item{cond1var}{Name of the first conditioning variable (controls
panel assignment in the vertical direction)}

\item{cond1var.lab}{Label for first conditional variable for slider. Defaults to NULL,
in which case \code{cond1} is used}

\item{cond2var}{Name of the second conditioning variable (controls
panel assignment in the horizontal direction)}

\item{cond2var.lab}{Label for second conditional variable for slider. Defaults to NULL,
in which case \code{cond2} is used}

\item{respbreaks}{Determines how the response data is divided into three groups
for coloring scheme. It can either be the integer 2 or a numeric vector of
two middle break points. Defaults to 2, in which case the response values are divided
into tertiles}

\item{cond1breaks}{Similar to \code{respbreaks}; determines how the first conditioning
variable values are divided into three groups for panel membership}

\item{cond2breaks}{Similar to \code{respbreaks}; determines how the second
conditioning variable values are divided into three groups for panel membership}

\item{respscale}{What scale to use for drawing the response variable slider. Must be
one of three values - actual (unchanged), percent (quantiles) and log}

\item{cond1scale}{What scale to use for drawing the first conditioning variable slider.
Must be one of three values - actual (unchanged), percent (quantiles) and log}

\item{cond2scale}{What scale to use for drawing the second conditioning variable slider.
Must be one of three values - actual (unchanged), percent (quantiles) and log}

\item{size}{Font size for model value labels and\eqn{R^2}. Defaults to size 10}

\item{seg1col}{Color of first interval of points by \code{respvar} value.
Cannot be 'cornsilk'. Defaults to 'blue'}

\item{seg2col}{Color of second interval of points by \code{respvar} value.
Cannot be 'cornsilk'. Defaults to 'darkgrey'}

\item{seg3col}{Color of third interval of points by \code{respvar} value.
Cannot be 'cornsilk'. Defaults to 'red'}

\item{optimize}{Logical value indicating whether panel assignment should be
optimized for \eqn{R^2}. Requires a long time to compute. Defaults to FALSE}

\item{otry}{Integer (greater than 0) indicating number of values to try
for optimization (see above). Required if \code{optimize = TRUE}.
Defaults to 20. A higher \code{otry} value leads to more precise estimates
at the cost of longer computation time}
}
\value{
